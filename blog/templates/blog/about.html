    John graduated from Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. The exposure 
    to various technologies he received while studying at NEIU and its ability to make an impact on other people solidified his 
    career choice of IT. The aspect that he enjoys most about technology is the level of creativity and interactivity that software 
    developers applies to their projects.  He is constantly sharpening his software development skills by reading up on programming 
    knowledge and concepts and working on personal projects, such as web apps, mobile apps, and solving common programming 
    problems. He likes to challenge himself by creating unique and inspired projects using the latest technologies. 
    His hobbies are playing video games, watching movies or TV shows, and software programming.
  <br><br>
  One of his most significant projects is called Hacker’s Island, which was an educational video game that teaches the players on how they can protect their anonymity against common cyber-attacks. The idea was to increase the public awareness of cybercrimes and cybersecurity. After conducting research on many forms of common cyberattacks, he used this knowledge and turned it into an educational video game. He improved his teamwork and communication skills by meeting deadlines and holding his team accountable. When John finds a problem that he is passionate about, he is determined and focused on solving it.
